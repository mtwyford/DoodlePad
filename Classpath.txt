For files r projects needing speacial or additional libraries imported or implemented,   
that are NOT within the normal scope of installed java libraries, you may need to  
install additional files, like the .jar file, or even add a 'classpath' or '-cp' to  
the compile and run execution statments, already built into your IDE.  

For Geany, the Java IDE used in our course, we may want to add those to the menu  
already built into the editor.
